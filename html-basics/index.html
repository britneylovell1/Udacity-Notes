          <h3 id="section-1-1-1">i. The Web</h3>
          <p>
              There are four major pieces to the World Wide Web. The
              <em>internet</em> is a network of computers that communicate
              to each other. When you want to access a website, your
              computer communicates to other computers by sending a
              <em>HTTP request</em> to their <em>server</em>. The correct
              HTML document is sent back to your computer using the
              <em>browser</em> to display it. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3 id="section-1-1-2"> ii. HTML </h3>
          <p>
              HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents are
              what make up most of the internet. These documents are comprised
              of text and tags that tells the browser how to project the text
              to the user. It is often in the form &lt;tag attribute="value">.
              HTML files determines the tree-like structure of the webpage.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3 id="section-1-1-3"> iii. CSS Files </h3>
          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. As the name suggests,
            CSS Files determines the style of the webpage.
            A CSS file is a separate document (labeled "insertnamehere.css")
            and is found in the same folder as the HTML file that we want to
            style. The CSS document is made up of selectors that refer to the
            class name of the element that we want to style. The selector
            tells the browser which element the rule (or declaration) inside
            the curly braces applies to.
          </p>
          <pre>
            selector {
              property: value;
            }
          </pre>
          <p>
            For example,
          </p>
          <pre>
            h1 {
              background-color: black;
              color: white;
            }
          </pre>
          <p>
            tells the browser that all h1 elements have a black background
            and white text.
          </p>

          <h3 id="section-1-2-1"> i. Helpful Tools </h3>
            <p>
              These tools allow you to see how a certain webpage was constructed.
              When using Google Chrome, click on tools > developer tools. This
              allows you to look at code for the entire html page. You can also
              click on an element on the webpage and press <b>control</b> >
              Inspect Element to access code for that specific element.
            </p>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3 id="section-1-2-2"> ii. Outlining Your Web Page </h3>
            <p>
              Start by placing "boxes" on your website grid. Decide where
              you want your main ideas to be placed on your webpage. Create
              div tags for each box (&lt;div>&lt;/div>). Give each box a
              class name (&lt;div class=“title”>).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3 id="section-1-2-3"> iii. Adding Style </h3>
          <p>
            There are three options to adding style:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li> You can add style with the style tag in HTML in the head.
              For example,
              <pre>
                &lt;head>
                  &lt;style>
                    div{
                      color: blue
                    }
                  &lt;/style>
                &lt;/head>
              </pre> 
              this tells the browser to make all text within div tags blue.
            </li>
            <li> You can use the style attribute in HTML. This is written
              inline within the body of the HTML doc. For example, 
              <pre>
                &lt;body>
                  &lt;div style="color : blue">This text would be blue.&lt;/div>
                &lt;/body>
              </pre>
              this tells the browser to make the text within those specific div tags the color blue.
            </li> 
            <li> We can also add style by refering our HTML Document to a CSS
              file in the same folder as our HTML doc. This is typically the
              ideal way of creating style. Let this be an HTML document called
              <em>main.html</em>. We will call the CSS document that we link
              to, <em>main.css</em>.
              <pre>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
                  <em> This tells the browser the type of document </em>
                &lt;html>
                  <em> Everything between the html tags is in html </em>
                  &lt;head>
                    <em> This is where you add the style file. It often looks like this: </em>
                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />
                  &lt;/head>
                  &lt;body>
                    <em> This is where you put the html structure </em>
                  &lt;/body>
                &lt;/html>
              </pre>
              The CSS document will look like:
              <pre>
                div {
                  background-color: red; 
                }
              </pre>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3 id="section-1-2-4"> iv. The Box Model </h3>
            <p>
              Recall that HTML documents are made up of boxes. Each box has
              4 components: content, padding, border, and margin. Sizing
              becomes a bit of a challenge considering all four components.
              We can approach this problem from two ways:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.</li>
              <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.
                <br>*{box-sizing: border-box;}
            </ol>
            <p>
              To reposition boxes, we need to resize them. Since divs are a block
              element, they will take up the width of the entire page. Using the
              rule "display: flex;" will allow the div boxes to appear next to
              each other.

          <!-- I used some of the verbage for the definitions from the Udacity notes. -->
          <p>
            In computer science, <em>variables</em> represent values. A value,
            or expression, is assigned to a variable name with an
            <em>assignment statement</em>.
          </p>
          <pre>
            &lt;variable name> = &lt;expression>
          </pre>
          <p>
            It is important to note that "=" does not mean "equals to", rather
            it is the operator that assigns the right side to the left side.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <em>string</em> is a sequence of characters surrounded by double
            or single quotes. Strings can be added, or <em>concatenated</em>,
            and multiplied. If
          </p>
          <pre>
            s = "Hello! "
            t = "How are you?"
          </pre>
          <p>
            Then,
          </p>
          <pre>
            s + t = "Hello! How are you?"
            s * 3 = "Hello! Hello! Hello! "
          </pre>
          <p>
            We can also index strings, using the form
            &lt;string>[&lt;starting expression> : &lt;ending expression>]. For
            example, if
          </p>
          <pre>
            s = "Computer Cat"
          </pre>
          <p>
            Then,
          </p>
          <pre>
            &lt;s>[0] = "C",
            &lt;s>[1 + 1 : 10/2] = "mpu"

        <h2 id="section-2-2"> II. Functions </h2>
        <div class="concept">
          <p>
            We define a function as such:
          </p>
          <pre>
            def &lt;function_name>(&lt;parameters>):
              '''
              function description
              '''
              &lt;block>
              return &lt;expression>
          </pre>
          <p>
            <em>Parameters</em> are passed through the function. The function
            does some calculations on the parameters and spits back the output.
            Defining a function is only the act of making a function. Calling a
            function is the actual use of the function. We enter in the specific
            parameters necessary for a program in place of the generalized
            parameters we created when defining the function. The <em>return</em>
            statement is what ends the function and spits back the output. If no
            return statement is present, the function passes back
            <code>'None'</code>. For example,
          </p>
          <pre>
            def &lt;create_an_animal(animal_1,animal_2):
              '''
              Concatenate two animals.
              Return new animal.
              '''
              new_animal = animal_1 + animal_2
              return new_animal
              
            print create_an_animal('cat','llama')
          </pre>
          <p>
            The result of running this program would be:
          </p>
          <pre>
            catllama

        <div class="concept">
          <h3 id="section-2-3-1"> i. While Loops </h3>
            <p>
              We define a <em>while loop</em> as such:

            <pre>
              while &lt;test_expression>:
                &lt;block>

            <p>
              If the test expression is True, then the block of code is executed
              over and over, until the test expression is False. Sometimes a
              <em>break statement</em> is needed to exit the while loop. 
            </p>
            <pre>
              while &lt;test_expression>:
                &lt;block>
                if &lt;test_expression>:
                  break
                &lt;block>
              &lt;after_while_loop>

        <div class="concept">
          <h3 id="section-2-3-2"> ii. For Loops </h3>
            <p>
              We define a <em>for loop</em> as such:

            <pre>
              for &lt;name> in &lt;list>:

            <p>
              A <em>for loop</em> goes through each element in the list in
              order and stops after executing the block of code for the last
              element in the list.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3 id="section-2-3-3"> iii. If Statements </h3>
            <p>
              We define an <em>if statement</em> as such:
            </p>
            <pre>
              if &lt;test_expression>:
                &lt;block>
            </pre>
            <p>
              If the test expression is true, then the block of code is executed.
              If not, then the block of code is skipped over. To test multiple
              cases, include <em>elif statements</em> and/or
              <em>else statements.</em>
            </p>
            <pre>
              if &lt;test_expression_1>:
                &lt;block>
              elif &lt;test_expression_2>:

            </pre>
            <p>
              The test expression in the if statement always returns a Boolean
              value - True or False. Sometimes operands - &lt; , >, ==, != - are
              used to decide which Boolean value needs to be returned.
            </p>
            <p>
              An <em>or statement</em> can also be used in the test expression.
              We define an or statement as such:
            </p>
            <pre>
              &lt;expression> or &lt;expression>
            </pre>
            <p>
              If the first expression is True, then the second expression is not
              evaluated. However, if the first expression if False, the second
              expression is evaluated. It only takes one True expression in an
              or statement to produce a True result. If both expressions are
              False, then the or statement returns False.

          <h3 id="section-2-4-1"> i. Lists </h3>
          <p>
            We define a list as such:
          </p>
          <pre>
            &lt;list_name> = [&lt;expression>, &lt;expression>, ...]
          </pre>
          <p>
            Similar to strings, lists can be accessed using the index. The main
            difference, however, between strings and lists is that a list is
            <em>mutable</em>. Strings, themselves, do not change, but lists can!
            For example, let's say
          </p>
          <pre>
            some_string = 'hello world'
          </pre>
          <p>
            Let's say that we decide to change <code>some_string</code> to a
            different string. For instance,
          </p>
          <pre>
            some_string = "good-bye y'all"
          </pre>
          <p>
            The actual string, <code>'hello world'</code>, has not changed. It
            is only the variable that it was assigned to has changed.
            <code>'hello world'</code> is still in the computer memory. When we
            reference <code>some_string</code>, it pulls up <code>"good-bye,
            y'all"</code> instead of <code>'hello world'</code>. Let's say,
          </p>
          <pre>
            some_list = ['a','b', 1 ,2]
          </pre>
          <p>
            Let's say we want to add <code>'yes'</code> and <code>'no'</code>.
            For instance,
          </p>
          <pre>
            some_list = some_list + ['yes', 'no']
          </pre>
          <p>
            Now <code>some_list</code> has changed. There is no such list
            called <code>some_list</code> with <code>['a','b',1,2] </code> as
            its elements anymore in the computer's memory. It has changed to
            contain <code>['a','b',1 ,2 , 'yes', 'no']</code>. This becomes
            important when we try to assign another variable to the new list
            we've created. Let's say that <code>another_list</code> is also
            assigned to <code>['a','b',1 ,2 , 'yes', 'no']</code>. Then,
            <code>some_list</code> and <code>another_list</code> are equal to
            each other. If we change one of the lists, then the other changes.
            For example, if
          </p>
          <pre>
            some_list[0] = 'uh-oh'
          </pre>
          <p>
            Then <code>some_list = ['uh-oh','b',1 ,2 , 'yes', 'no']</code> and
            <code>another_list = ['uh-oh','b',1 ,2 , 'yes', 'no']</code>.
            Because the list, itself, has changed, then both the variables
            assigned to the list are still equal to each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can add or append elements to a list. Adding elements with '+'
            simply adds each single element to the end of a list. Appending
            elements perserves the structure of the elements being appended.
            For example,
          </p>
          <pre>
            print some_list + ['maybe', 'okay']
            print some_list.append([3, 4])
          </pre>
          <p>
            would yield this result:
          </p>
          <pre>
            ['uh-oh','b',1 ,2 , 'yes', 'no', 'maybe', 'okay']
            ['uh-oh','b',1 ,2 , 'yes', 'no', 'maybe', 'okay', [3,4]]
          </pre>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The <em>Python Standard Libary</em> contains different
            <em>files</em> filled with pre-made functions. We can think of the
            Python Standard Library as a filing cabinet. Inside the filing
            cabinet are a bunch of folders organized by content. Inside each
            folder, or <em>file</em>, are related functions. To use these functions in a
            python program, we need to access the file within the Python
            Standard Library by importing it, as such:
          </p>
          <pre>
            import webbrowser
            
            webbrowser.open("webpage_address")
          </pre>
          <p>
            This program opens up a webpage by calling the function, <code>
            open()</code>, which is found within the file, <code>
            webbrowser</code>, inside the Python Standard Library. Not having
            to see the actual code for the function <code>open()</code> is
            called <em>abstraction</em> and allows us to focus on writing the
            code we want without having to worry about every single detail. 
            Go and explore more files and functions in the
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html">Python
            Standard Library</a>!
            The Python Standard Library also contains
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html">
            built-in functions</a> that don't require the importation of a file.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="lesson">
        <h2 id="section-2-8">VIII. Classes</h2>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3 id="section-2-8-1">i. What is a class?</h3>
          <p>
            A <em>class</em> is a set of instructions, like a blueprint,
            found within a file. We can create distinct <em>objects</em>,
            or <em>instances</em>, of a class using the instructions within the
            class. As a blueprint for a house can present a house with yellow
            walls and another house with blue walls, so a class can present
            similiar but distinct objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the Python Standard Library has much to offer, there are
            some packages that are available outside the PSL that we can
            download. Twilio, for instance, is a package that sends text
            messages. 
          </p>
          <pre>
            from twilio import rest
            
            client = rest.TwilioRestClient(account_sid, auth_token)
          </pre>
          <p>
            This is only a snippit of the actual code that allows us to send
            text messages. In this code, <code>client</code> is an object of
            the class, <code>TwilioRestClient</code>. This class is found
            inside the file, <code>rest</code>, which is inside the file,
            <code>twilio</code>. So this code says, "from the file called
            <code>twilio</code>, import the file called <code>
            rest</code> so that we can use the class, <code>
            TwilioRestClient</code>." 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3>ii. Creating a Class</h3>
          <p>
            Let's create a python document called, <code>classDocument.py</code>
            and within it, let's define a <em>class</em> as such:
          </p>
          <pre>
            class ClassName():
              &lt;statement-1>
              &lt;statement-2>
              ...
              &lt;statement-N>
          </pre>
          <p>
            A class contains statements, which can be both <em>class
            variables</em> and <em>methods</em>. Class variables are just
            variables defined with the class and methods are just functions
            defined within the class. Commonly found within a class is the
            class variable, <code>__doc__</code>, which provides information on
            how the class works. This class variable is usually declared as
            such:
          </p>
          <pre>
            '''This is what the class does.'''
          </pre>
          <p>
            When we call it in this way,
          </p>
          <pre>
            classDocument.ClassName.__doc__
          </pre>
          <p>
            the output will be <code>This is what the class does.</code>
          </p>
          <p>Also commonly found within a class is the
            class <em>constructor</em>, also known as the <code>__init__</code>
            function, and it is defined as such:
          </p>
          <pre>
            def __init__(self, argument1, argument2, ..., argumentN):
              self.name1 = argument1
              self.name2 = argument2
              ...
              self.nameN = argumentN
          </pre>
          <p>
            The instances created in defining the class, <code>
            ClassName</code>, are defined in a separate python document, but
            saved in the same directory as <code>classDocument.py</code>. We
            create an instance as such:
          </p>
          <pre>
            import classDocument
            
            instance_1 = classDocument.ClassName(argument1, argument2, ..., argumentN)
          </pre>
          <p>
            All the variables associated with an instance is called <em>
            instance variables</em>.
          </p>
